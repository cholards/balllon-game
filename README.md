A video game that consists of two players floating using 100 helium balloons. 

The players shoot pellets at each other’s balloons and after 10 minutes the player with the most balloons left wins.

The function balloonAttack that takes two Player instances, calculates the balloons left for each player after 10 minutes (using the hitsPerMinute property) and returns the name of the winner. If the result is a tie, return the string 'Tie'.

Two instances of the Player class were created  to test balloonAttack functionu as arguments.

Feel free to use the status() method to output each player’s balloon count at any given time.
